  <p id="corner1" class="corner">Rogue</p>
  <p id="description1">The rogue is a lone agent who lives and travels in the shadows. A dagger will be your only (and best) friend, and your enemies will fall to your knife at close proximity. Your weakness is to engage in face-to-face combat; your goal is to avoid the enemy until you are at their back. With your footsteps as silent as the night, your wits as sharp as your blade, and a face that no one (alive) knows, they will never se you coming, and they won't have the time to know what hit them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 container" >
  <p id="corner2" class="corner">Warrior</p>
  <p id="description2">Warriors live and die defending the backs of their brothers and sisters. The sword is their ally, their soul, and life. The warrior faces his/her enemy face-to-face in battle, garbed in his/her choice and weight of armor. As a warrior, you can abandon your sword for the strength of an axe, the range of a bladed staff, or the blunt and crushing force of a mace. The warrior meets the enemy and the day head on - and conquers both at every turn.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12 container">
  <p id="corner3" class="corner">Warlock</p>
  <p id="description3">The warlock is a steward of lost knowledge, a manipulator of time and space, and a conjurer of beings from far-away realms. As a warlock, you will equip your staff, gather your spells, and guard yourself with invisible shields. Summoned other-wordly creatures will face the enemy for you as you call forth fire, ice, lightening, and control the ground beneath their feet from afar. Control the elements, summon armies of beasts, and defeat your foes with magic.</p>
